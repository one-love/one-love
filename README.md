One Love
========

### Overview

One Love is web-based application which aims to make managing multiple hosting providers, with multiple hosts on them easier.

It uses [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com) roles which are shared via [Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/) hosting providers APIs and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to create a powerful interface which controls all the aspects of cloud infrastructure.

The idea is to create software which is able to manage multiple hosting providers which all have multiple hosts on them. You can put hosts into groups and apply roles based on those groups, for easier management of large number of machines.
