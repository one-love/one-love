One Love
========

### Overview
One Love is web-based application which aims to make managing multiple hosts on multiple hosting providers easier.

It uses [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com) roles which are shared via [Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/) hosting providers APIs and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to create a powerful interface which controls all the aspects of cloud infrastructure.

The main idea behind One Love is to automate a majority of the processes when it comes to setting up and configuring a large number of host machines, both on same or different hosting provider.
